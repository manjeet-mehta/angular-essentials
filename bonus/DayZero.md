### Setting up the repository is a TODO in itself.

Before setting up repository for first time, Have a better understanding of .gitignore file.  
**Hack-101** In windows you can't create a file with name '.gitignore' so name it '.gitignore.' and windows will automatically save it as '.gitignore' as This will skip the validation of having a file extension, since is actually has an empty file extension.

    
**Hack-102** :- It's not a hack but ya if you are a noob like me rightnow you can Just go to [gitignore.io](https://www.gitignore.io/) and add the specification of your project like "Angular","Windows","Visual Studio code" and it will generate a gitignore file for you.  

For more information regarding gitignore go to  [how-to-use-gitignore](https://www.pluralsight.com/guides/how-to-use-gitignore-file).
